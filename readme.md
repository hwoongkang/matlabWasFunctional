# Functional programming using MATLAB
I recently found out that MATLAB actually follows the functional paradigm, whether intended or not.

## higher order functions
you can pass in functions as arguments using function handles

## currying
Currying is possible by creating function handles with custom arguments

## array filtering
Yet using the "dotted methods" is not possible,

you can still filter the arrays using its default features

## closure
Nested functions are fully supported, which makes it possible to implement Closures in "Pythonic" way
